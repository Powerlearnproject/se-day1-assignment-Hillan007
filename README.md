Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended and fixing any bugs.

Maintenance: Updating and improving the software over time to keep it relevant and functional.

Project Management: Coordinating tasks, timelines, and resources to ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Development of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s):

Description: Before high-level programming languages, software was written in machine code or assembly language, which was tedious and error-prone. The creation of high-level languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) revolutionized software development by allowing programmers to write code using more human-readable syntax.

Importance: High-level languages increased productivity, reduced errors, and made it easier to learn and write complex software. This milestone laid the foundation for modern programming languages and software development practices.

The Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):

Description: Structured programming introduced the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, manageable modules or procedures. This approach was championed by Edsger W. Dijkstra, who promoted the use of control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines to improve code organization and readability.

Importance: Structured programming improved software quality and maintainability, making it easier to debug and enhance programs. It also paved the way for more advanced software engineering methodologies and practices.

The Adoption of Agile Methodologies (2000s-Present):

Description: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration between cross-functional teams. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, outlined key principles for flexible and adaptive software development.

Importance: Agile methodologies have transformed the software development landscape by promoting faster delivery of value to customers, improving team collaboration, and allowing for more responsive and adaptive development processes. Agile practices have become widely adopted in the industry, driving innovation and efficiency in software projects.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
